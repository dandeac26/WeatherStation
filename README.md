#Weather Station

Esp8266 weather station with DHT22 sensor

##Intro:

Plant is a weather station that I tried to make as useful as possible. It is designed to work on a LithiumIon battery that can be charged through a micro usb, and then placed somewhere in your room where it
looks good and can be used any time through your network a site you can always connect to and check
the Temperature and humidity of the room in which the plant was placed on.

##Schematic:

This schematic shows how the all the pieces are connected. Unfortunately, so far, I have not managed to
make all the components work together. For now, it works well with the humidity and temperature
sensors, though the BMP sensor can get the humidity and air pressure, I figured it wasnâ€™t really that
important, though I included it either way in the schematic.
