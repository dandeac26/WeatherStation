##Intro

Plant is a weather station that I tried to make as useful as possible. It is designed to work on a LithiumIon battery that can be charged through a micro usb, and then placed somewhere in your room where it
looks good and can be used any time through your network a site you can always connect to and check
the Temperature and humidity of the room in which the plant was placed on.
